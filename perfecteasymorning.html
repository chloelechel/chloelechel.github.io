      <h2>How to Have the Perfect Easy Morning!</h2>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="article">
    <p>Everyday seems to be getting up early, getting ready, eating an on-the-go breakfast (It's not truly a breakfast. Probably just a banana.), running out the door, and going to work. Then, you finally get what you've hoped for—a day off. The problem is, you've adjusted to a morning routine where everything is rushed. Now you don't quite know what to do with your free morning. Here's an idea on how to have the perfect easy morning!</p>
    <p><b>The Night Before</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't set an alarm! This will only be a nuisance to you in the morning and disturb your sleep cycle.</li>
        <li>Plan out your breakfast and make sure you have the correct ingredients! If you plan your breakfast the night before, you'll be excited about what you're going to make when you get up the following morning. Also, chances are, you'll make a healthier food choice.</li>
        <li>Follow a good night routine! If you want to wake up refreshed, get a good night's sleep. If you wanted to try any overnight facial treatments, this would be a good idea.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><b>Waking Up</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You wake up as the sun rises. What are your options?</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>If you're wide awake and don't feel like going back to sleep, go for an early morning workout. Whether it be cardio or a mild stretching routine, get some fresh air and start your morning out with a workout.</li>
        <li>If you're still tired, *go back to sleep!* Sleep is essential in order to have a good morning! If you're tired for the entire day, you likely won't be in a good mood. So if you feel the need to sleep more—go ahead! You have the day off!</li>
    </ol>
  <p><b>Breakfast</b></p>
  <ul>
      <li>Drink a large glass of water! Drinking water right after you wake up is a great way to start up your metabolism and wake you up in the morning!</li>
      <li>Eat what you planned the night before! Maybe you wanted to try a new recipe from Pinterest or you just wanted to make some oatmeal. Whatever you chose, make it!</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>During Breakfast</b><p>
    <ul>
        <li>While enjoying your delicious meal, do something that relaxes you. Catch up on a Netflix show, listen to a podcast, journal, or hear the new songs you just added into your music library. Have an easy, slow morning.</li>
    </ul>
  <p><b>After Breakfast</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take a shower! Then, change into your comfortable clothes. Your favorite pair of jeans with a t-shirt and your comfiest jacket. Oh, and a thick pair of the fuzziest socks you can find in your drawer. Don't blow-dry your hair, let it air dry. If you want to put on makeup, go for a lighter makeup. BB cream instead of foundation, no eyeshadow for the day, a light translucent powder. Or, if you tend to wear makeup everyday, give your skin a break and don't wear makeup! If you're staying inside the house all day, do a facial! Give your skin all the treatment it needs.</li>
    </ul>
  <p><b>Starting the Day</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have the entire day away from work. Start or finish a personal project! Maybe you wanted to finish a book. Finish it! Or you might have wanted to organize your bedroom. Organize! Any personal project that's been on your mind for a while, get it done! It's something you enjoy and it'll feel so good once you are able to check it off your to-do list.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The point is—if you have a morning off, don't rush! Work against the rushed, stressed morning routine many have and simply relax. Wake up slowly, eat a good breakfast, and work on something you love. I hope you have a great morning!</p>
